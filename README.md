Creating new fusion patches with unDAW from existing SFZ and DSPreset instruments found online - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBUht2z7a2Y

All the practical info in this readme is outdated, just right click a midi file to create a sequence, at the moment (16/06/2024) - there's isn't a BP exposed way to play the sequence in game, I'm going to add an actor that does that, with cpp you can grap the metasound builder from the DAWSequencer asset and audition it.

Some videos until I make a proper demo - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-tbrrys2V091Wv94E5xbvGdLrwm_79i_?usp=sharing

Esentially, drag a midi file into unreal, right click it, choose 'Edit in BK Editor', click on the 'refresh' icon to generate the metasound and then hit 'play', it will default to pianos on all channels, press F1 to switch to the mixer and switch Fusion patches and the such. Ctrl/Shift + Mouse Wheel to zoom in and out in the editor. 

Can also drag SFZ and Decent Preset sample files to unreal and it will auto create fusion patches, more documentation coming...


## V0.0.1! First public release! Currently only the Midi Editor Widget is substantially developed, can also use the Decent Sampler importer to quickly make fusion patches. More to come!
